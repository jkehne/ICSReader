ICSReader is a synchronization provider which periodically downloads
calendars in ICS format from the internet and inserts their contents
into the Android calendar.

After installing, you can configure your calendar via settings ->
add accounts.

Features:
* Supports multiple calendars
* Configurable sync interval
* Authentication support
* SSL support

Limitations:
* Currently, the configuration of existing calendars cannot be edited
* All calendars are assigned the same color

Bugs:
ICSReader is NOT stable! You should not rely on it in a production 
environment! Also, I assume no responsibility for lost data, missed
appointments, crashing devices or any other negative consequences that
may arise from using this app!
If you encounter any bugs, please use GitHub's bug tracking system to
